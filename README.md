# <Braydens-WeatherDashboard-Module-6-Challenge>

## Description

I wanted a website to display a 5 day forecast weather dashboard! I learned how to implement Jquery and cards from bootstrap, how to work with rgba linear gradient in the stylesheet, how to implement my own API key, how to append API elements, and using a for loop to go over a 5 day span !
